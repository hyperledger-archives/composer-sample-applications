# Fabric Composer Sample Applications

The repository contains sample applications written against the [Fabric Composer](https://github.com/fabric-composer/fabric-composer) [client and admin APIs](https://fabric-composer.github.io/jsdoc/index.html). 

Currently this contains the code and scripts for the ['Getting Started'](https://fabric-composer.github.io/start/quickstart.html) tutorial.

We welcome Pull Requests for new applications - please see the [contributing notes](https://github.com/fabric-composer/fabric-composer/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). 

*IMPORTANT NOTE*  The Getting Started application is the main route for people to get started with Fabric Composer - please exercise care when changing it!
